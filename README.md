> **Pre-Alpha Mode**
> I wouldn't use this if I were you. There's still hard-coded data pertaining to the original author. Right now, the core of this application is a CMS ready for scheduled mass-publishing. There's still a-lot of work.

This is the public source code for a content management system for content heavy websites. Deploy to Vercel, and use the built in CMS to manage your content. **NOTE: This project used premium features in the services we use. Please be aware of the costs before using this project.**

## Why?

Why build a CMS when you could use one of the many alternatives?

1. A need to remain close to the source code while providing a flexible admin experience.
2. To build a writers experience that doesn't suck.
3. To provide all the benefits of a highly secured CMS out of the box.

## Getting Started

### Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is a PostgreSQL wrapper that provides data storage for this application. Supabase wins for it's ease-of-use within the JavaScript community. In addition, there's a generous free plan that makes getting started achievable for everyone. For more backend oriented folks; the self-hosting aspect allows for the traditional development experience if one should choose to go that route.

**Setup Supabase**

The easiest way to setup Supabase is via the Supabase CLI. Try these steps to get setup, if you have any questions or encounter issues; kindly open a new issue in this repository or email <6matbub@gmail.com> with the subject "Chroniconl CMS Support" and I (Mat) will get back to you.

1. From your Supabase Dashboard, create a new database (Password will be needed in Step 4).
2. Install the CLI https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started
3. From within the root directory of this repository, run `supabase login` to connect to your Supabase account
4. Run `supabase link` and select the database you created. Follow the prompts to connect, you may need the password you created in step 1.
5. Run `supabase db push` to push the supabase/migrations into your Supabase database.
6. Your Supabase database should now be populated with the schema required to run the application.

### Start the project

Now that you have your `.env.local` file set up, and storage is setup in Supabase, you can start the project.

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the project in development mode, and you can make changes to the code and see the changes in real-time. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

### Deploy to Vercel

Once you're ready to deploy, you can use Vercel to deploy the project to your own domain.

1. Create a Vercel account if you don't already have one.
2. Navigate to the project on Vercel.
3. Click the "Deploy" button.
4. Follow the prompts to deploy the project to your own domain.

## About the Stack

Next.js (app router) x TypeScript, TailwindCSS x shadcn/ui, Zustand, Supabase, Clerk, UploadThing, Vercel, TipTap is a pretty integral part of this app's interface too.

### Why Clerk, isn't that expensive?

Initially the auth provider was admin-only. We'll be migrating to Supabase Auth soon.

### Can I change the auth provider?

Yeah, the `users` table is flexible in that aspect. When you create a new user, you can set the `provider` to any value you want. We default to `clerk` but you can change it to `supabase` or `auth0` for example, whatever you want.

### Why UploadThing?

An easy way support [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg); because he keeps me entertained for hours, plus the pricing is rad.

### Why TipTap?

Best user experience for writing content in a rich text editor (WYSIWYG). It's great now, and I have no reason besides past experiences to be skeptical, but I'm super nervous about maintenance around this package. Mostly being that ain't nobody going to be fork and maintain this project if the open-source version gets abandoned. _Basically, if for any reason we have to migrate to another rich text editor, we'll be in some shit._

### Why not use Markdown and static pages like a regular person?

Static blogs are cool for solo developers or teams that publish relatively infrequently. This project initially began as a static blog but has since scaled to a full CMS.

### Why Zustand?

Because Redux seems mildly unnecessary for this project.

### Why Supabase?

Supabase provides a safe way to scale this project quickly. It provides this front-end focused project peace-of-mind.

## FAQ

### Why is my Blog Post not showing up?

If you've already created a blog post and are expecting it to show up on the homepage or be accessible via direct link, make sure you've set the posts "Visibility" field to "Public". In addition, ensure the "Publish Date" field is set to a point in the past.
