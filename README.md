## Why?

Why build a CMS when you could use one of the many alternatives?

1. A desire to remain close to the source code while providing a flexible admin experience.
2. To build a writers experience that doesn't suck.
3. To provide all the benefits of a highly secured CMS out of the box.
4. I'm having fun taking this project as far as it can go.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites and accounts required

- Node.js
- Pnpm
- GitHub account (Some knowledge of Git is required)
- $ Vercel account (Hosting)
- $ Supabase account (API keys required)
- $ Clerk account (API keys required)
- $ UploadThing account (API keys required)

> I'm working on consolidating some of these. Please check back soon or consider contributing if you'd like to help out.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repo

First, clone the repo:

```shell

```

#### 2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`

Navigate to the root directory and run `pnpm install`.

```shell

```

#### 3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory

You can use the `example.env.local` file as a template for your `.env.local` file. Note the comments in the file, follow the links provided to obtain your API keys. **If you try to start the project without these keys, you'll run into errors or at the least, unexpected behavior.**

```shell
# Development Options
DEV=true # or DEVELOPMENT=true

### Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is a PostgreSQL wrapper that provides data storage for this application. Supabase wins for it's ease-of-use within the JavaScript community. In addition, there's a generous free plan that makes getting started achievable for everyone. For more backend oriented folks; the self-hosting aspect allows for the traditional development experience if one should choose to go that route.

**Setup Supabase**

The easiest way to setup Supabase is via the Supabase CLI. Try these steps to get setup, if you have any questions or encounter issues; kindly open a new issue in this repository or email <6matbub@gmail.com> with the subject "Chroniconl CMS Support" and I (Mat) will get back to you.

1. From your Supabase Dashboard, create a new database (Password will be needed in Step 4).
2. Install the CLI https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started
3. From within the root directory of this repository, run `supabase login` to connect to your Supabase account
4. Run `supabase link` and select the database you created. Follow the prompts to connect, you may need the password you created in step 1.
5. Run `supabase db push` to push the supabase/migrations into your Supabase database.
6. Your Supabase database should now be populated with the schema required to run the application.

### Start the project

Now that you have your `.env.local` file set up, and storage is setup in Supabase, you can start the project.

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the project in development mode, and you can make changes to the code and see the changes in real-time. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

### Deploy to Vercel
